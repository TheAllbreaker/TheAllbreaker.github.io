## Definition

Chainbreaking or simply Breaking is the act of breaking a bond between a person and an alliah, without killing him/her nor destroying the alliah. When a bond is destroyed, the connection between a person a the alliah is gone forever, while every thought, memory, feeling and emotion invested in the bond (if the bond is Forged) is taken from the person and stored in the mind of he Chainbreaker, instead. It is, in tandem with [Rattling](Rattling) and [Bondforging](Forging), one of the three <++>.

## Powers

Being able to break a bond essentially means to take a part of someone's one self and steal it. The breaking of a bond scarres the mind and leaves a "hole" in them, making the person numb and "deppressed", as they lose part of their consciousnes. To be able to break a bond, the Chainbreaker must invest both physical and mental effort. The greater the bond, the greater the toll on the Chainbreaker. To be able to effectivelly break a bond, the Chainbreaker requires physical contact with the alliah or the person. It is easier to break a bond from the alliah (which is the "receiver") than from the person (which is the "source" of the bond).

There are different kinds of breaking, depending on the amounts of bonds and their type:
* **Purge:** Purging is the act of breaking a single bond between person and alliah. It is the most common form of breaking and the least risky for the Chainbreaker.
* **Shatter:** Shattering is the most feared form of Chainbreaking, as it means the destruction of every bond a person has to every alliah. Since everything is connected to everyone to some degree (unless the specific bond has already been broken) this breaks every form of connection of a person with the world on a conscious level, leaving the Shattered in a near vegetative-state, essentially breaking their soul forever. To result of a Shattering for the Chainbreaker is rather high, too. A Chainbreaker will "absorb" the consciousness (memories, thoughts, feelings, emotions, personality) of the Shattered inside of his own mind, granting access to that persons knowledge if trained well-enough.
* **Liberation:** Liberating is a form of Chainbreaking that breaks the bond not between a person and an alliah, but between a person and the Chains of Fate. This would grant the person "freedom" of the mandates of the past, present and future, allowing them to forge a new destiny. It is said that only the Allbreaker can perform Liberation whitout Shattering a person.

## Drawback

As stated before, there are 2 main drawback of Chainbreaking:
* The physical and mental toll of breaking a bond is high, specially if the bond is Forged. The Chainbreaker often ends up exhausted and with fuzzy thoughts.
* Chainbreaking requires the consciusness invested in the bond to be "stored" in the mind of the Chainbreaker. While this has its advantages (as being able to access memories and thoughts that can provide useful information), more often than not this new consciousnes will start to emerge and merge with the Chainbreakers own thoughts and memories. The Breaker would slowly but surely start going mad the more he Breaks, losing his own original self. This is the main reason why Chainbreaking is a dangerous technique. This is specially true for those who have Shattered.

## Other Details

* A Chainbreaker cannot "die" as a direct result of breaking a bond. Whowever, Shattering someone (mainly if the breaker is unexperienced) can leave the Chainbreaker in a coma.
* Chainbreakers are feared mostly for their ability to Shatter, as it completly nullifies the soul of the Shattered from bonding again and going back to the Grand Forge.
* Some refer to Chainbreaker as Soulburners.
* Since you cannot Forge with other persons self-consciusness, Chainbreakers that have used their powers a lot can no longer have Forged Bonds with an alliah, as they can no longer fully distinguish their mind from that of the Shattered.
* A Shattered con no longer Rattle, nor have a Forge Bonds antmore, as every bond they had was destroyed.
* To Shatter another Chainbreaker would mean to absorb not only their mind, but the mind of those that were Shattered by him.
* A strong-willed Chainbreaker can resist the mind-entanglement of breaking to some degree, ut eventually will fall to illusions and madness the more he breaks bonds.
* Purging a non-Forged Bond usually doesn't store any consciusness inside the Chainbreaker unless the bond is naturally strong, meaning that the person would not lose almost any memories or thoughts, and if it happens usually they are sporadic and scarce ones.
* Unknowlingly, while Shaterring a Chainbreaker also is performing Liberation, beacuse it also breaks the bonds with past and future. If a Shattering would affect only present bonds (as with Purging), they would still have some degree of consciousness because of their past bonds (for example, memories and feelings for people who have already died, or objects that already been broken or destroyed).

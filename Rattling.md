# Rattling

## Definition

Rattling is the most common form of magic in <++>, as every living being is able to rattle if they have a Forged Bond. It is the act of channeling the powers of the Grand Force to the physical world, using a Forged Bond as a conduit. It is, in tandem with [Chainbreaking](Breaking) and [Bondforging](Forging), one of the three <++>.

## Requirements

To be able to Rattle, the Rattler must have a Forged Bond. Normally, sentience would be required to forge a bond, but some non-sapient being have are able to forge bonds and therefore Rattle.

The easiest and most common way of Rattling is by channeling through a Metralliah, as their stronger composition allows them to withstand the effets of Rattling rather well. Stronger materials, such as rock and metal, have been proven to be resist the side-effects of Rattling the best. Conductive materials allow for better channeling and a therefore stronger Rattling (Glass is an exellent material for Metralliah is sheer power is needed, but its fragility means it would almost surley break after only one use). Naturally, this means that conductive metals are the preferred choice for Metralliah.

Rattling through a Sigalliah is possible, but most living creatures would not withstand the channeling proccess and perish. Wolvargar are the only living beings whose body is strong enough to channel without dying or even suffering mayor damage, although most Rattling Wolvargar have shorter lifespans because of this.

## Powers

The power of Rattling comes directly from the Sentients, and therefore Rattlers can only channel a specific form of energy depending on the Sentient blood in them. The different kinds of Rattlers are:
* [Flareshooter](Flareshooter): Those attuned with the Domain of Ardor are called Flareshooters. Their powers involve channeling heat, fire, lighting and light in the mediums. They can cast fireballs, lightingbolts, and flashes of light.
* [Senseshaker](Senseshaker): Those attuned with the Domain of Notion are called Senseshakers. Their power involve dwelling with illusions and hightening of the senses.
* [Formbuilder](Formbuilder): Those attuned with the Domain of Form are called Formbuilders. Their power involve the augmentation of physical abilities such as strength and speed, as well as density modification to become lighter or more robust.
* [Dreamheater](Dreamheater): Those attuned with the Domains of Ardor and Notion are called Dreamheaters. They can use the powers of both Flareshooters and Senseshakers, as well as combine them. For example, to cast an illusion as a Senseshaker you would have to touch the person, but a Dreamheater can cast it through the light that enters the victim's eyes.
* [Rayshaper](Rayshaper): Those attuned with the Domains of Ardor and Form are called Rayshapers. They can use the powers of both Flareshooters and Formbuilders, as well as combine them. For example, they can apply the energy to their body of alliah, or even cast the energy with a physical form.
* [Forcefeeler](Forcefeeler): Those attuned to the Domains of Notion and Form are called Forcefeelers. They can use the powers of both Senseshakers and Formbuilders, as well as combine them. For example, they can heighten the senses of other beings, induce physical pain on their enemy with an illusion, etc.
* [Lightpulsar](Lightpulsar): Those attuned with the Domains of Ardor, Notion and Form are called Lightpulsars. They can use the power of Flareshooters, Senseshakers and Formbuilders, as well as combine them.
* [Ruinbinder](Ruinbinder): Those attuned with the Domain of Ruin are called Ruinbinders. They have access to the forces of evil, which involve persuation, mind control, corruption, disease and re-bonding. They can attune to the other Domains temporarily by re-bonding a person with that specific Domain.

## Drawbacks

The main drawback for rattling, and the primary reason why most people do not rattle, is that the Rattler requires a Forged Bond. Forgers are uncommonn and they must be willing to Forge a bond for the Rattler. Furthermore, the Metralliah must be prepared to withstand heavy use of Rattling, so rattling with a non-metalic object often results in the alliah breaking sooner rather than later.

The other major drawback of Rattling is that it impacts the Rattler's body heavily. When channeling, most of the toll is absorbed by the alliah, but the user also channels with its own body. Rattling causes muscle stiffness, dehidration, gradual loss of the senses, a burning sensation of the body and different level of amnesia. This means that Rattling heavily will damage the Rattler, and surpassing one's own limits will result in a coma or even death. It is said that once the eyes of the Rattler start burning, that limit is reached, and pushing further is extremely dangerous.

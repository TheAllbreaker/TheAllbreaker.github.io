# Bondforging

## Definition

Bondforging or simply Bondfoging is the act of "creating" a spiritual bond between a person and an object or being. Only a Bondforger can create this magical link. An object bonded to a person is commonly refered to as Metralliah, and abeing bonded to a person is called Sigalliah. It is one the branches of [Sentinexia](Magic)

## Powers

When a person is bonded to an Alliah (either Metralliah or Sigalliah), the individual can "feel" their alliah, as if they were an extension of their own body. They can feel when they are near and sense when they are in danger. The bond is greater the closer the person and the alliah are.

Sigalliah can "feel" the other person in the same way, as their shared bond is reciprocal. A strong enough bond can allow them to communicate telepathicaly to some extent, feel their emotions, and even share dreams.

Metralliah on the other hand allow the person bonded to them to [Rattle](Rattling). When the bond is strong enough, the marks of the <++> appear over their surface. Since Metralliah become a channel for Rattlers to use their powers, these objects stress when being used, meaning they can break or wear overtime. Beacause of this, the best material for Metralliah are conductive metals, especially Aollum (which is the core material with which the Sentients where made of).

## Proccess of Bondfoging

To be able to forge a bond between a person and an alliah, a Bondforger must perform a special process. This involves both the person and the Bondforger to link part of their self-conscious to that object. This "self-conscious" involves memories, feelings, sensations towards something or someone. The stronger the feeling, the stronger the bond. For this process to carry through succesfully, the Bondforger must be touching both person and alliah at all times until the forging is done. A failed foring can mean the permanet loss of that "self-conscious", and/or damage to the alliah.

The Bondforger can be the "person", meaning forging a bond himself with an alliah. Normally, when the Forges creates a bond for himself, its easier for him to create the bond. However, this bond tend to be weaker as it is created only with the "self-conscious" of 1 person.

## Drawbacks

There are many reasons why forging is scarce and dangerous. For once, the number of forgers in really low (less than 1% of people are forgers, and even then most of them never realise or now this).

While forginf a bond, either for himself of for another person, the Bondforger puts part of his self-consciuos to create and mantain the bond. However, is the bond is broken (either by a Breaker, or because the person or the alliah are killed/destroyed) then that part of the self-conscious is gone forever, meaning a Bondforger can lose memories, feelings for something or someone, they lose part of themselves. A repeated process of losing self-conscious can drive a person to madness, being irrecognizable from who they once were.

Another drawback is that forging is a teddious process, as it stresses the body significantly and causes the Bondforger temporal amnesia. If they stress to hard they can collapse, stopping the forging without it being finished. This can harm the alliah, and can make the memories and feeling be lost forever.

## Other Details

* There is no limit in the amount of bonds a person can have (in fact, everything is bonded to everyone in a sense, Bondforgers just enhance that bond rather than creating it).
* You cannot be bonded twice to the same alliah (however, as stated before you can enhance this bond, and the "self-conscious" invested in the bond wont be lost, be enlargened).
* There is no known form of de-forging a bond to recover the invested self-conscious.
* A [Chainbreaker](Breaking) can break a bond without killing the person or destroying the alliah.
* Bondfoging in <++> is used a form of matrimony. In their culture, Forgers become Priests.
* Even when the Bondforger is killed, the bond between person and alliah remains (unless the Bondforger was the person). This means that their self-conscious is still invested in the bond. Many Bondforgers hace used this method to "store" important memories.
* It is possible for Sigalliah to be a channel so the Rattler can use their powers, however the toll of being the conduit often means the death of the Sigalliah and the breaking of the bond. Wolvargar essentially use themselves (living being, Sigaliah) as their channels to Rattle, the difference being that their blessing of durabillity allows them to withstand the Rattling proccess without killing themselves inmeadiatelly.

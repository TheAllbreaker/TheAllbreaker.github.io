Flareshooting is the act of Rattling with the Domain of Ardor. The Rattler of this specific domain are called Flareshooter.

## Powers

Flareshooter can channel different forms or energy through their alliah into the physical world. They can rattle fire, lighting, light and heat. Ther are other forms of energy that can be rattled, but are far less common and often required the Rattler to have another attunement to either Perception, Form, or both.

The most common form of Flareshooting in a fighting environment is to cast fireballs and lighting. Light can be rattled to use as a lantenr, or it can be rattled in a powerful flash to blind the opponent. Heat can be rattled to heat up the environment, though a Flareshooter cannot heat its own body directly.

It is the prefered form of basic Rattling for soldiers.

## Drawbacks

The stronger the energy rattled, the bigger the toll on both the alliah and the Rattler.
